Project works in its entirety, be sure to run the authentication server under
plugins. There was an error with a lexic_cast from the boost library but it
appears we have fixed it (we are slightly unsure of the source except it being
related to ptimes coverting to and from strings). There is an error that throws
explainging the quick fix if it does come up (one for authentication as well).
Be sure to have boost installed (boost-libs should be a dependency, if isn't
then it also needs to be installed). Occasionally we used each others laptop to
code and pushed updates from a single laptop/account.


Signatures (Use git blame to verify signatures, hahahah):
-- Brandon Bauer: This was a satisfying one!
-- Tyler Hoover: Now this is clean architecture.
